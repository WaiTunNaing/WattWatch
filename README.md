# WattWatch

Watt-Watch is a smart home energy management and energy saving system that I designed together with five other UC Berkeley engineering students during the summer of 2020. The system utilizes the information collected from the smart outlets and the AI Watt-son in order to provide a personalized energy saving plan for each user. <br/> <br/>

Aside from single and double outlet versions, there are also power strip version, in-wall version and black box version for the smart outlets. With Watt-Watch, users can expect to reduce energy waste and electricity bill at households by at least 33% while also enjoying the game-like design of customizing your own Watt-son. <br/> <br/>

For a typical refrigerator (on for 24 hrs a day normally, 20 hrs scheduled with Watt-Watch), <br/>
